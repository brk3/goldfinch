Overview:
---------
Goldfinch is another unfinished project of mine that started with a combination
of needing something to work on and the desire for a more comprehensive CLI
twitter than something like ./twitter update status blah.

It currently allows a user to view their timeline, friends, and post tweets,
but is still in an early stage and nowhere near ready for daily use.

Requirements:
------------
* python2.6
* tweepy (https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy)
